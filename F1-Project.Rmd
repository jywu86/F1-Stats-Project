# Background and Purpose

Formula 1 also known as F1 is a series of races (Grand Prix) is a globally recognized sport and is one of the fastest growing sports in the United States. The sport has been around since the early 1950s and is considered as the pinnacle of motorsport. To be the F1 world champion is synonymous with being the absolute best. Each year a driver and a team (also known as constructor) is awarded a championship based on the points won each season.

Unlike other major sports in the United States such as the NBA where sixty rookies enter the league each year; opportunities in F1 are rare. There are a total of 20 "seats" across all of Formula 1 and in 2022, only one rookie was given a Formula 1 seat. The average career in Formula 1 is about 8 seasons. With such small opportunities and sample sizes, teams are left with the hard choice of either locking up a former world champion for a high amount or risk giving a chance to a newbie or average driver for 3-4 years on a contract.

There is a common saying that there is F1 and then there is F1.5. This is referring to the large gap in performance between the top two or three teams in a given season and the rest of the field. This discrepancy is due to the difference in budgets between the top teams (approximately \$485 million per year) and the back marker teams (\$145 million per year). As small teams have to rely heavily on sponsors to continue with the added pressure of performing to appease the said sponsors.

The purpose of this project is to use classification models to understand the effect of which factors are the most important for top-tier, mid-pack (best of the rest), and low-tier (AKA backmarkers) and what would be an ideal strategy for each team aiming to move from each tier. Also to answer the question of how well does each driver rank within their team as a way of comparing individual driver ability.

# The Data

The data used for this project was a mixture of a public dataset from Kaggle (<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020>) with further enrichment from a package FastF1 (<https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1/>).

This data was broken down into multiple sheets with cross referenced ids and had data available for races from 1950 to 2020. The sheets are broken down into mainly two types of data: reference data and result data. Not all data was used to create the models and a summary of the data used is listed below. Additionally, enhancements to some of the data was used to further enrich additional variables for data modeling.

## Data Assumptions and Wrangling

<<<<<<< HEAD
The majority of the data provided and extracted are categorical variables. The results of each race and amount of each race is a discrete distribution. However, the variables within each category are assumed to be normally distributed (average speed, lap times, temperature of environment, etc.).

In the original dataset, there were 4 explanatory variables available to model our classification models. (grid, circuit, driver, fastest_speed) Our concern was the lack of additional variables given to us to produce models with different combination of variables. Therefore, a large effort was made to create additional variables such as Air.Temp, Track.Temp, Wind.Speed, Weather, Race.Circuit type (street or racing circuit), n_of_Sharp_Turns, car_performance, track_type based on speed, and turns per mile. We normalized car performance data by using the qualifying times of each team and comparing the difference in time of each team against the fastest team of the qualifying session.
=======
Formula 1 as a sport has changed drastically over the years and is broken down into separate eras of similar cars based on their technology. We would like to compare as similar of cars as possible so the era chosen was the most recent era coined the "Turbo-Hybrid" era which comes from the use of a hybrid engine along with turbos. This era began in 2014 and has only just ended in 2021 to make way for a new era in the sport. Furthermore, most contracts for drivers range between 1-5 years and many young drivers don't make it past 3-4 years in the sport.

With this in mind we decided to utilize data from 2018 to 2021 to build our model and make an applicable equivalency to a typical contract length and to keep similar drivers and teams.

Lastly, due to the nature of the data there is some existence of dependencies with certain variables such as car performance, driver performance, and grid order. In our models we viewed each as a system of variables that describes a certain feature. (i.e grid is the location of the each racer relative to each other, car performance is the pure performance of a car by averaging two drivers, and driver's racecraft such as maneuvering, blocking, and/or ability to read situations).

## Data Selection

Formula 1 as a sport has changed drastically over the years and is broken down into separate eras of similar cars based on their technology. We would like to compare as similar of cars as possible so the era chosen was the most recent era called the "Turbo-Hybrid" era which comes from the use of a hybrid engine along with turbos and occurred between 2014 to 2021 which is the subset of our analysis.

Furthermore, most contracts for drivers range between 1-5 years and many young drivers don't make it past 3-4 years in the sport. We decided to take data from 2018 to 2021 to build our model and make an applicable equivalency to a typical contract length and to keep similar drivers and teams.

Additionally, we omitted races where a driver had to retire and was not able to complete the race. In racing, these could be a result of a collision, mechanical issue, or illness.

![Total Completed Races by Driver](Figures/Completed%20Races%20(Pareto).jpeg){width="6in"}

Throughout the four years, there were 32 total drivers that participated in at least 1 formula one race. There were many drivers that had less than 40 races and many did not have race data in one of the four years. We chose to go after the top 10 drivers with completed races in an effort to limit the driver variables and to limit the amount of incomplete data in the dataset. These drivers were Hamilton, Vettel, Bottas, Perez, Sainz, Rakkonen, Gasly, Stroll, Leclerc, and Verstappen.

# Purpose 1

To understand the differences between top, mid-tier, and backmarkers, we decided to run classification models for 3 different types of race results. In our first analysis, we looked at classification models to predict race wins.

### Race Wins:

<<<<<<< HEAD
To find the best classification model, we decided to run 3 different types of models: logistic regression, random forest, and XgBoost. One issue with classifying race wins is that the "Win" positive class is extremely small when compared with the "Lose" category. In the 81 races, there is a proportion of 5% (1 in 20 average) in the Win class and 95% in the Lose class. Therefore, to evaluate our model we will be heavily relying on the sensitivity accuracy.
=======
To find the best classification model, we decided to run 3 different types of models: logistic regression, random forest, and XgBoost. With XgBoost, we tuned our model by looking at a variety of parameters (iterations, tree_depth, learn_rate, and gamma function). \##### MAYBE NEED TO INSERT ADDITIONAL CHARTS FOR PARAMETER TUNING
>>>>>>> b8d3dacbcbd44938e07cdf88871c2fcb0cbc7b8a

We used ROC curves based on test data to give us an overview with default parameters to find the optimal threshold for each model and looked at the overall accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity (with "Win" as the positive class) for all three models.

![ROC for Win Classification Models](Figures/ROC%20Curve%20for%20Win%20Lose.jpeg){width="4.8in"}

Overall, it appears that all models were comparable with the Boost model having a slightly higher AUC. For our analysis, we are primarily interested in the "Win" prediction and what factors are important to achieve this result. Therefore, setting the threshold to 0.1 for both Logistic and Forest models looked to give us the best overall score and highest specificity score and setting the threshold value to 0.05 appeared to be the best threshold for the boost model.

With the following thresholds, we then ran the models with a 60/40 split with cross validation of 5 folds and found the following accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity on the test data.

: Accuracy Scores for Classification Models (Race Wins)

Comparing across all 3 models, it appears that the Logistic Regression model performed the best when it came to fitting against the Win class and the Random Forest model gave slightly better predictions against the Lose class. All three accuracy scores are within the 95% confidence intervals between each other and therefore the model accuracy is similar. In the analysis below, we will use the Logistic Regression model to explain our race win data and the Random Forest Model to explain our lose data. While performing the analysis below, we will attempt to improve our model further through the use of stepAIC to limit siginificant variables in our logistic model and in the Random Forest we will leave only top importance variables.

#### Win Model:

Using the stepAIC function to tune our logistic model revealed that the two variables with the most amount of importance was "Grid" and "driverRef". The sensitivity score from this model was 88.9% and had a specificity score of 74.0%. A breakdown of the following coefficients are shown below:

| Variable                                              | Coefficients |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Grid - Order in which drivers line up before the race | -0.417       |
| Hamilton (Driver)                                     | 2.4107       |
| Max_Verstappen (Driver)                               | 1.5088       |
| Vettel (Driver)                                       | 0.5895       |
| Leclerc (Driver)                                      | 0.3154       |
| Raikkonen (Driver)                                    | -0.1053      |
| Perez (Driver)                                        | -0.4409      |
| Stroll (Driver)                                       | -15.0108     |
| Sainz (Driver)                                        | -16.0613     |
| Gasly (Driver)                                        | -16.1000     |
| Bottas(Driver)                                        | Reference    |

: Logistic Regression (driverRef, grid) Coefficients (Win-Class)

The reference driver used in this model was Bottas and a brief look at these coefficients shows that the top drivers (Hamilton and Verstappen) have an exceedingly high effect on the potential for a race win than compared with the reference driver. Both of these drivers stayed on the same team for all of the four years and were involved in the top team (Mercedes and Red Bull) with the most amount of wins. This model reflects that result heavily.

When looking at the top three drivers (Hamilton, Verstappen, and Vettel) seem to be able to outweigh the negative effect of a one or two bad grid units. Hamilton appears to erase almost 6 grid units and Max with 3 when compared with Bottas.

![Driver Wins from 2018 - 2021](Figures/Driver_Win_Pareto.jpg){width="5in"}

The more interesting points come from drivers such as Raikkonen, Vettel, Leclerc, and Perez (Mid-tier drivers). These drivers have switched teams and moved from top teams to middle/backmarker teams throughout their career. During this period, Leclerc specifically seems to stand out as he secured 2 wins in the 2019 season which is similar to Perez, but has a much larger positive influence on race wins probability. On the opposite spectrum, it appears that Gasly has a much lower influence than his surrounding drivers and significantly lower than Raikkonen, Perez, or Leclerc even though they've had similar number of wins.

A note of reference is that when drivers stay on the same team for all 4 years it is difficult to separate their performance and the performance of the car. One way to compare is to look at drivers and their teammates. The reference driver was Bottas which has also been on the Mercedes team for all 4 years, however when comparing his coefficient; it appears that Hamilton has a significant weight over his teammate when it comes to race wins.

### Podium Finish (Top 3)

We ran the same analysis for podium finishes with the following model assessments with ROC curves to find the best thresholds and AUCs.

![ROC for podium classification models](Figures/ROC%20Curve%20for%20Podium%20Models.jpeg){width="4.8in"}

The AUC for all models were comparable with the Logistic model showing the highest AUC. The same 60/40 split was performed and 5 fold cross validation for both the Random Forest and Gradient Boost models.

+----------------------------------------+----------------+----------------------+--------------------------+
| Model Type                             | Accuracy       | Sensitivity (Podium) | Specificity (Not Podium) |
|                                        |                |                      |                          |
|                                        | (95% CI)       |                      |                          |
+========================================+================+======================+==========================+
| Logistic Regression (Threshold \> 0.2) | 80.8%          | 93.9%                | 74.2%                    |
|                                        |                |                      |                          |
|                                        | (75.9%, 85.1%) |                      |                          |
+----------------------------------------+----------------+----------------------+--------------------------+
| Random Forest (Threshold \> 0.2)       | 81.5%          | 97.0%                | 73.7%                    |
|                                        |                |                      |                          |
|                                        | (76.7%, 85.7%) |                      |                          |
+----------------------------------------+----------------+----------------------+--------------------------+
| Gradient Boost (Threshold \> 0.1)      | 76.7%          | 97.9%                | 66.6%                    |
|                                        |                |                      |                          |
|                                        | (71.5%,81.5%)  |                      |                          |
+----------------------------------------+----------------+----------------------+--------------------------+

Although the Boost model had the highest sensitivity parameter, the accuracy for that model is the weakest out of the 3 with a confidence interval that does not overlap either of the two models. The Random Forest Model showed a very high sensitivity at a threshold of 0.2 with an overall higher accuracy throughout across all three models. The specificity in the logistic regression is slightly higher with comparable accuracy to the Random Forest Model.

In the analysis below, we used the Random Forest Model to explain differences in gaining podium places and removed less important features to try to generalize and get a better sensitivity. All three models showed relatively weak specificity compared to their sensitivity and therefore are not good models for exploration. However due to logistic regression's ability to show coefficients, we will explore the logistic model to look at specificity for podium spots.

#### Podium Finish

The overall model showed high importance on grid, qualifying_dif (car performance), and driver and marginal importance on Type(track type) and track distance (mile). After cycling through a variety of these elements, the model that improved overall accuracy while keeping the relatively high sensitivity was based on the grid, driver, car performance, track type, and distance.

![Variable Importance for Podium Places](Figures/VarImp%20(Podium)%20Forest.jpeg){width="3.8in"}

The most important variables for determining podium places were grid and car performance. More interesting results come from looking at the drivers and their relative rank of importance with each other. Max appears to have an ever slight higher importance than Hamilton when it comes to gaining podiums. Perez, Gasly, and Sainz are all in a comparable group. Without completely understanding the coefficients, it is hard to discern if these drivers had positive effects or negative.

To gain insights into the magnitude and direction of each variable, we passed the most important variables based on the Random Forest into a logistic regression model and got the following coefficients.

| Variable                         | Coefficient |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| Verstappen (driver)              | 1.4388      |
| Hamilton (driver)                | 0.9613      |
| Vettel (driver)                  | -0.2160     |
| Raikkonen (driver)               | -0.4954     |
| Sainz (driver)                   | -0.6929     |
| Gasly (driver)                   | -0.7250     |
| Leclerc (driver)                 | -0.7586     |
| Stroll (driver)                  | -1.0674     |
| Perez (driver)                   | -1.1211     |
| grid                             | -0.3232     |
| qualifying_dif (car performance) | -79.6861    |
| Bottas                           | Reference   |

: Coefficients of Logistic Model (Podium Finish)

Looking at the coefficients below, only Verstappen and Hamilton have favorable coefficients against Bottas. Additionally, Leclerc appears to belong to the mid-tier drivers when it comes to getting podiums. And when compared to his actual podium amounts is severely underperforming and only outperforming Perez which has lowest coefficient of all drivers. Perez is especially surprising as in the Random Forest Model, his importance was grouped together with Gasly, and Sainz. Raikkonen seems to also perform well in the logistic model splitting the difference between Vettel (4th highest podium counts) and Sainz.

The large difference between Hamilton and Bottas is surprising as these two drivers were teammates throughout the entire 4 year period and highlights Hamilton's dominance throughout this period. ![Podiums by Driver (2018-2021)](Figures/Podiums%20by%20Driver.jpeg){width="4.3in"}

Overall from our models, to achieve a podium the important factors are grid position and car performance. Similar to Race Wins, the environmental variables are more significant with lower tiered teams such as teams that Gasly, Stroll, and Perez belong to. The standout in this group of drivers would be Sainz as he has shown to have be important in both the logistic and Random Forest model.

### Avoiding the BackMarkers (Rank 1-6)

Similarly, we looked at all three types of classification models and performed a ROC analysis to find the best thresholds and compare AUCs.

![ROC for Top Teams Classification Models](Figures/ROC%20for%20Top%206%20Models.jpeg){width="4.5in"}

Again logistic regression had the highest AUC and the gradient boost was able to provide the highest sensitivity.

+----------------------------------------+----------------+----------------------+--------------------------+
| Model Type                             | Accuracy       | Sensitivity (Podium) | Specificity (Not Podium) |
|                                        |                |                      |                          |
|                                        | (95% CI)       |                      |                          |

Comparing the 3 models, the logistic regression had the highest AUC and all were above 90%. In terms of sensitivity, Gradient Boost gave the higher sensitivity with almost an equal drop in the specificity. The two models used to show Top6 and out of Top6 would be Gradient Boost and Random Forest. Similar to all analysis previously ran, we tried to tune our models to score even higher in either sensitivity or specificity while maintaining optimal accuracy, however was unable to get a better model than the default settings. The tuning parameter charts are found in the appendix.

In gradient boost, the top variables were grid, qualifying_dif, Track.Temp, and to a smaller degree drivers. We used these top variables to build our model and fine tune the specific parameters surrounding XgBoost (rounds, max_depth, learning rate, and gamma loss).

We found that with boosting iterations of 1600, the accuracy was the highest; however the first dip in accuracy occurs at a boost iteration of 300. To avoid overfitting, we set the boost iteration to 300 for this reason. Looking at the max tree depth, significant increase was found going from a 7 depth to 10, however for much of the same reason with overfitting; we decided to use a max depth of 5 as this is when the first plateau is. Our learning rate was set at 0.1 and our Gamma function was set to 1 based on the tuning parameters above.

Measuring this model gave us an overall accuracy of 80.8% (Sensitivity - 81.1%, Specificity - 80.5%) and was comparable in accuracy, but much lower in Sensitivity. This shows that there may have be an issue with overfitting and the initial model was adopted to explain Top6 finishes.

![Variable Importance for Top 6 Model](Figures/Backmarker%20Model%20Imp.jpeg){width="3.8in"}

Based on the variable importance on the XgBoost model, the most important root node was grid, car performance, and track temperature. The first two variables may be obvious as the faster your car, the easier it is to get towards the front and also the higher up in the grid a driver is placed the more likely they are to defend and keep that position. There are certainly relationships between grid, car performance, and drivers in specific cars that may be magnifying the importance of these variables. These are all prevalent in the two models above. However as we move towards the middle, we start to see environmental variables become slightly more important than the previous podium and race-win models.

![Example of XgBoost Tree](Figures/Example%20Decision%20Tree.jpeg){width="5in"}

In fact, when looking at an example tree diagram from the model, it appears that having grids at 6 or below was crucial. This may be obvious since it's many times easier to defend your position in a race versus overtaking potential opponents. As XgBoost is an ensemble model, this example is just one tree of many to find the likely probability of a Top 6 finish. However it is still valuable to see where the trees split and the decisions made. For instance, Sainz as a driver has a relative high level of importance as it is close to the root nodes. As seen in the variable importance chart above, Sainz's importance is close to that of Verstappen.

### Conclusion to Purpose 1

By looking at finishes in tiers (Wins, Podiums, Teams), we are able to see some obvious relationships. Firstly, grid position appears to be a huge portion of importance when it comes to determining all finishes. In a real life setting, rid position, car performance, and teams are closely related. In cases where drivers stayed with one team for the duration of the 4 years, their performances were a lot more consistent and from our models, it was harder to separate the driver and the car.

For race wins, it appears that environmental factors are not as important as compared to other finishes. The main portions that are important is the driver and the position at which they start the race. This is evident in the dominance that is seen with Hamilton throughout this period with 47 wins out of a possible 81. However, in our model it was picked up that LeClerc with his relative lack of race win results compared to his rivals might be someone that is outperforming his peers with similar outcomes.

For podiums, we see a similar result with the top drivers and a great emphasis on the car performance. The difference between winning and podiums from our model is that Verstappen is king when it comes to podiums. Even though he has less overall podiums than Hamilton, his rating for podiums is measurably higher based on our logistic model. Our diamond in the rough for podiums appears to be Sainz as he was able to show much higher influence while not having as many podium results in our dataset.

As we move away from the front of the grid, our models start to show that environmental factors start to outweigh some individual drivers. For instance, track temp was relatively high as compared to driver importance on the back marker models, but was not seen on either Race win model or Podium model.

<<<<<<< HEAD
To answer our original question of the factors that surround top teams, mid teams, and back markers; if you are a top team manager getting the right driver is critical. The difference between Bottas, Hamilton, and Max are fairly significant. If you are a mid tier team, your driver becomes slightly less important; getting someone like LeClerc where the potential to win is relatively high compared to his peers may get you towards the front of the pack. If you are on the backmarker, invest in your car and technology would be the advise. The environmental variables start to matter more in the back and the driver influences are harder to discern from each other. However, picking up someone like Sainz would be an ideal candidate given that it does not take away budget for investment into your car.

However, in reality all Formula 1 teams employ a variety of these strategies. Some portions that are not highlighted in this model are how well the drivers can develop a car through experience. The different strategies employed by each team for each driver is also crucial to understand. Formula 1 is an exciting sport with a lot of interconnected variables. This project's purpose was to shed some light on potential factors that may matter more than others.

# PURPOSE 2 ANALYSIS (Type below this line and I will type above it.

A teammate in F1 is the closest rival because this is the closest scenario in which two drivers may be operating equal machinery. The second purpose of this project is to evaluate individual drivers and their relative values when compared to their teammates.

To analyze the variable importance and coefficients found within Teams, which have very similar cars, and for Individuals. In other words... what factors have a higher importance for each team/individual? Is this a positive or negative correlation?

## Method

For each ind/team a random forest model will be used to assess Variable Importance. Secondly, a Logistic Regression model will be used to analyze coefficients. The Logit Regression models show values that did not have low P-Values and futher steps with a StepAIC analysis would without doubt remove many of the variables presented in the below graphs. These are purposefully kept in, as our purpose with the Logit Regression model is to understand whether or not an explanatory variable has a negative or positive association. However, variables with a significant p-value will be more than insightful. The classification (Win, Top3, Top6) chosen for each individual/team had the highest specificity/sensitivity. Since these are independent models, we chose the classification that best represented each ind/team.

### Insights (Teams):

The most notable insight between Ferrari and Mercedes is the Variable Importance of Driver Reference. On Mercedes the most valuable node is if the Driver is Lewis Hamilton or not. Secondly, we see that this is a positive coefficient from our Logit model with a high P-value represented by the \*\*\*. On the other hand, Driver Reference for Ferrari had the lowest Variable Importance and while did not show any significance in our Ferrari W/L Logit model coefficient graph, it did have a pvalue of .1082 with 97 degrees of freedom. What this indicates is that when the "car" is accounted for Lewis Hamilton is showing why he is paid the highest amount in the league.Driver Ref == "Hamilton" had less than a .005 pvalue with 113 degrees of freedom. No other variable had a significance level less than .12.

Another Insight considered, was the higher Variable Importance of environmental factors (Wind Speed, Track Temp, Weather) on the Ferrari team. As these environmental factors increase we see a negative correlation within our Ferrari Logit Coefficients. A deeper analysis shows that the Logit P-Values for Ferrari were (Wind Speed : .93, Track Temp: .53, & Rained : .99). In other words... there may be some value discovered by the Random Forest Variable Importance, but without more data these coefficients are unreliable.

### Insights (Individuals):

One notable insight from our individual racer models is the Importance of Team Rank for Hamilton and lack there of for Bottas. Keep in mind these two racers have been on the same team for the last four years. With that said, it might be plausible that the Team Rank variable (How well the "car" qualified) would indicate similar Importance for the two. If the overall Qualifying rank for the team is lower, insinuating a better environmental fit for the Mercedes car, then both Bottas & Hamilton might see a positive correlation. However, this isn't true for Bottas. This could be a further indication of Lewis Hamilton's ability to overcome environmental factors and only have the machine and himself to account for any mistakes. Secondly, Grid has very rarely been outside of the #1 Variable Importance factor. In further examination of the Lewis Hamilton Logit model, the p-value for "Grid" is .59. After doing a StepAIC() analysis the only remaining coefficient is Team_Rank and Gris is removed. Lewis Hamilton is showing that even when he falls lower in the Grid ranking position there is no significance in his ability to secure the Win. For further validation on this, the only coefficient with a significant P-Value for Bottas is the Grid at a p-value of 0.034.

### Purpose 2 Conclusion:

Each driver and each team have different Variable Importance factors and correlation. It can be difficult to dive further into this with such small sample sizes, and we aren't following the best practices for either model. We used the two different models to piece together an understanding of the factors that effect drivers/teams. That being said we were able to make some considerable correlations that we can be confident in. Lewis Hamilton is showing the ability to be beyond environmental factors, and even the strongest factor for any other driver... the starting position. Where other teams have very little difference between drivers, indicating a potential strength of the car, Mercedes winning a race is highly correlated with that driver being Lewis Hamilton. Another interesting item to note, is that Bottas had 8 wins himself. The true difference is that Hamilton had 47 alone. I'll leave you with the final answer. Is Lewis Hamilton worth \$30 million?
