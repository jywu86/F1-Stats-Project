# Background and Purpose

Formula 1 also known as F1 is a series of races (Grand Prix) that take place all across the world including countries from Europe, Asia, North America, and the Middle East. The sport has been around since the early 1950s and is considered as the premier league for open wheel racing. Points are awarded in each race to both the driver and the team that the driver belongs to. Each team is allowed two drivers with closely matched cars and currently (2022) there are 10 teams with 20 drivers in total. Each year two championships are awarded; one for the driver with the most points and the overall team (or constructor).

Historically, F1 has been classified into three main tiers: "Top Teams", "Midfield" (AKA Formula 1.5), and "Backmarkers". A large reason why these top teams remain on top is due to the much larger budgets and can be up to four times the budget of a smaller team. The bulk of these larger teams' budgets is spent in development and can be many years ahead of teams considered in the backmarker. The same can be said for drivers, where the top driver from Mercedes (Lewis Hamilton) makes approximately \$30 million and the best driver from the backmarker team Haas (Mich Schumacher) makes approximately \$1 million. However, in 2020 a budget cap was agreed upon and team budgets are maximized at \$145 million per year. Currently, this does not include driver salaries however it would not be unfathomable to believe a salary cap may also be enforced in the future like many other professional sports.

The purpose of this project is to use classification models to understand the effect of which factors are the most important for top-tier, mid-pack, and back-marker and what would be an ideal strategy for each team aiming to move from each tier. Also to answer the question of how well does each driver reflect their current relative market value.

# The Data and Wrangling

The data used for this project was a mixture of a public dataset from Kaggle (<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020>) with further enrichment from a package FastF1 (<https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1/>).

This data was broken down into multiple sheets with cross referenced ids and had data available for races from 1950 to 2020. The sheets are broken down into mainly two types of data: reference data and result data. Not all data was used to create the models and a summary of the data used is listed below. Additionally, enhancements to some of the data was used to further enrich additional variables for data modeling.

## Data Selection

Formula 1 as a sport has changed drastically over the years and is broken down into separate eras of similar cars based on their technology. We would like to compare as similar of cars as possible so the era chosen was the most recent era called the "Turbo-Hybrid" era which comes from the use of a hybrid engine along with turbos and occurred between 2014 to 2021 which is the subset of our analysis.

Furthermore, most contracts for drivers range between 1-5 years and many young drivers don't make it past 3-4 years in the sport. We decided to take data from 2018 to 2021 to build our model and make an applicable equivalency to a typical contract length and to keep similar drivers and teams.

#INSERT PARETO OF DRIVERS AND TEAMS

Based on the given dataset, there were 4 explanatory variables available to model our classification models. (grid, circuit, driver, fastest_speed) Our concern was the lack of variables given to us to produce models. A large effort was made to create additional variables such as Air.Temp, Track.Temp, Wind.Speed, Weather, Race.Circuit type (street or racing circuit), n_of_Sharp_Turns, car_performance (normalized against the fastest team per race), track_type based on speed, and turns per mile.

```{r , echo=FALSE}

```

To simply our split, we split the tracks above an average speed of 140 mph to be high speed tracks and everything below to be low speed tracks.

# Data Selection

In order to enrich our dataset, we used the ergast API through a package in Python called FastF1 to add additional environmental variables. Through the use of this package, we were able to add the variables, Track Temperature, Air Temperature, Wind Speed, Average Throttle Input (per driver), and Average Brake Input (per driver).

Formula 1 is broken down into separate eras of similar cars based on their technology. We would like to compare as similar cars as possible so the era chosen was the most recent era called the "Turbo-Hybrid" era which comes from the use of a hybrid engine along with turbos and stems from 2014 to 2020.

The dataset is broken up into qualifying.csv - this outlines all the times and laps set in

The inital dataset did not include weather and telemetry (e.g. full throttle, braking) data which was later enriched through our script in "Data_Enchancements.py".

## Data Preparation

# Purpose 1

To understand the differences between top, mid-tier, and backmarkers, we decided to run classification models for 3 different types of race results. In our first analysis, we looked at classification models to predict race wins.

### Race Wins:

To find the best classification model, we decided to run 3 different types of models: logistic regression, random forest, and XgBoost. With XgBoost, we tuned our model by looking at a variety of parameters (iterations, tree_depth, learn_rate, and gamma function). \##### MAYBE NEED TO INSERT ADDITIONAL CHARTS FOR PARAMETER TUNING

We used ROC curves based on test data to give us an overview with default parameters to find the optimal threshold for each model and looked at the overall accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity (with "Win" as the positive class) for all three models.

![ROC for Race Win Classification Models](Figures/ROC-Curves_for_Win.jpg){width="7in"}

Overall, it appears that all models were comparable with the Boost model having a slightly higher AUC. For our analysis, we are primarily interested in the "Win" prediction and what factors are important to achieve this result. Therefore, setting the threshold to 0.1 for both Logistic and Forest models looked to give us the best overall score and highest specificity score and setting the threshold value to 0.05 appeared to be the best threshold for the boost model.

With the following thresholds, we then ran the models with a 60/40 split with cross validation of 5 folds and found the following accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity on the test data.

+-------------------------------------------+---------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+
| Model Type                                | Accuracy            | Sensitivity (Win Class) | Specificity (Lose Class) |

+-------------------------------------------+---------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+

: Accuracy Scores for Classification Models (Race Wins)

Comparing across all 3 models, it appears that the Logistic Regression model performed the best when it came to fitting against the Win class and the Random Forest model gave slightly better predictions against the Lose class. All three accuracy scores are within the 95% confidence intervals between each other and therefore the model accurarcies are closely similar.

#### Win Model:

Using the stepAIC function to tune our logistic model revealed that the two variables with the most amount of importance was "Grid" and "driverRef". The sensitivity score from this model was 88.9% and had a specificity score of 74.0%. A breakdown of the following coefficients are shown below:

| Variable                                              | Coefficients |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Grid - Order in which drivers line up before the race | -0.417       |
| Hamilton (Driver)                                     | 2.4107       |
| Max_Verstappen (Driver)                               | 1.5088       |
| Vettel (Driver)                                       | 0.5895       |
| Leclerc (Driver)                                      | 0.3154       |
| Raikkonen (Driver)                                    | -0.1053      |
| Perez (Driver)                                        | -0.4409      |
| Stroll (Driver)                                       | -15.0108     |
| Sainz (Driver)                                        | -16.0613     |
| Gasly (Driver)                                        | -16.1000     |
| Bottas(Driver)                                        | Reference    |

: Logistic Regression (driverRef, grid) Coefficients (Win-Class)

The reference driver used in this model was Bottas and a brief look at these coefficients shows that the top drivers (Hamilton and Verstappen) have an exceedingly high effect on the potential for a race win than compared with the reference driver. Both of these drivers stayed on the same team for all of the four years and were involved in the top team (Mercedes and Red Bull) with the most amount of wins. This model reflects that result heavily.

AWhen looking at the top three drivers (Hamilton, Verstappen, and Vettel) seem to be able to outweigh the negative effect of a one or two bad grid units. Hamilton appears to erase almost 6 grid units and Max with 3 when compared with Bottas.

![Driver Wins from 2018 - 2021](Figures/Driver_Win_Pareto.jpg){width="4in"}

The more interesting points come from drivers such as Raikkonen, Vettel, Leclerc, and Perez (Mid-tier drivers). These drivers have switched teams and moved from top teams to middle/backmarker teams throughout their career. During this period, Leclerc specifically seems to stand out as he secured 2 wins in the 2019 season which is similar to Perez, but has a much larger positive influence on race wins probability. On the opposite spectrum, it appears that Gasly has a much lower influence than his surrounding drivers and significantly lower than Raikkonen, Perez, or Leclerc even though they've had similar number of wins.

A note of reference is that when drivers stay on the same team for all 4 years it is difficult to separate their performance and the performance of the car. One way to compare is to look at drivers and their teammates. The reference driver was Bottas which has also been on the Mercedes team for all 4 years, however when comparing his coefficient; it appears that Hamilton has a significant weight over his teammate when it comes to race wins.

#### Lose Model

To look at the variables that had the most effect on not winning, we chose to use the random forest model based on its relatively high specificity score. When we ran the Random Forest model against the test data, we got a specificity score of 78.6% which was similar to our score when only using the training data. The top variables that aligned with this model were Grid, Driver, Car Performance (qualifying_dif), and Rainfall. With this reduced model, we were able to bring up the specificity score up to 85.4% when running against the test data.

![Variable of Importance (Win)](Figures/Forest_Win_Imp_Tree.jpg){width="4in"}

Our random forest paints a similar picture as it appears Hamilton, Verstappen, and Grid all have some of the highest influences on race wins. A few points are shown that was not seen in the logistic model. Firstly, the grid order seems to have a higher influence than Verstappen's influence and also Verstappen's importance is similar to how much car performance there is. Qualifying_dif is a variable that is calculated by finding the percentage difference between the qualifying times of a team (average of 2 drivers) and the fastest team. (e.g. If a team is slower by 8% per lap, their car performance is 92% the performance of the fastest team). Based on the random forest model, it appears that most environmental variables have more affect on a loss than the majority of drivers.

### Podium Finish (Top 3)

We ran the same analysis for podium finishes with the following model assessments with ROC curves to find the following thresholds. (See Appendix for additional ROC curves)

+----------------------------------------+------------+---------------------+----------------------+--------------------------+
| Model Type                             | AUC        | Accuracy            | Sensitivity (Podium) | Specificity (Not Podium) |
+========================================+============+=====================+======================+==========================+
| Logistic Regression (Threshold \> 0.4) | 92.5%      | 80.8%               | 93.9%                | 74.2%                    |
|                                        |            |                     |                      |                          |
|                                        |            | 95CI (75.9%, 85.1%) |                      |                          |
+----------------------------------------+------------+---------------------+----------------------+--------------------------+
| Random Forest (Threshold \> 0.4)       | 92.1%      | 83.5%               | 87.9%                | 81.3%                    |
|                                        |            |                     |                      |                          |
|                                        |            | 95CI (78.8%, 87.5%) |                      |                          |
+----------------------------------------+------------+---------------------+----------------------+--------------------------+
| Gradient Boost (Threshold \> 0.1)      | 90.2%      | 76.7%               | 97.9%                | 66.6%                    |
|                                        |            |                     |                      |                          |
|                                        |            | 95CI (71.5%,81.5%)  |                      |                          |
+----------------------------------------+------------+---------------------+----------------------+--------------------------+

Although the Boost model had the highest sensitivity parameter, the accuracy for that model is the weakest out of the 3 with a confidence interval that does not overlap either of the two models. Due to this difference, the two models that will be selected is the Logistic Regression for Sensitivity and Random Forest for Specificity.

#### Scoring Podiums

Once again, we used stepAIC to determine variables that were the most relevant for the logistic model as well as the simplest. The step function reduced the variables to grid, driver, Rainfall, car performance (qualifying_dif), and distance per turn. At optimal threshold, this model increased its accuracy to 83.5% and a sensitivity of 88.9%.

| Variable                         | Coefficient |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| dist_s\_turns                    | 3.9167      |
| Verstappen (driver)              | 1.5079      |
| Hamilton (driver)                | 0.8722      |
| Vettel (driver)                  | -0.3813     |
| Raikkonen (driver)               | -0.5070     |
| Sainz (driver)                   | -0.8876     |
| Leclerc (driver)                 | -0.9698     |
| Gasly (driver)                   | -1.0414     |
| Stroll (driver)                  | -1.4145     |
| Perez (driver)                   | -1.4444     |
| Rainfall2Wet                     | -1.2820     |
| grid                             | -0.3583     |
| qualifying_dif (car performance) | -73.2314    |
| Bottas                           | Reference   |

: Coefficients of Logistic Model (Podium Finish)

Based on the reduced logistic model, it appears that the car performance has the biggest effect on the chances of getting a podium. There also appears to be some positive weights attached to circuits where the distance per turn is higher; indicating that potentially in higher speed circuits; our reference driver tends to prefer when it comes to achieving podiums.

In the race win model, the largest effects were caused by the two top drivers for the two top teams. There may be some relationship due to the top drivers usually driving the top cars. And there is no surprise that this is also consistent for achieving podiums. However, an interesting point is that in terms of a Hamilton vs Verstappen comparison; it appears that Verstappen may more weight in terms of achieving podiums.

Again, a surprising comparison of drivers is LeClerc and a Sainz which based on the logistic model are extremely similar in weight.

![Total Podiums Achieved (2018-2021)](Figures/Driver_Podium_Pareto.jpg){width="3in"}

This is surprising because of the lack of amount of podiums from Sainz as compared to Leclerc yet while Leclerc was more favorable in terms of winning; in terms of podiums the model views these two drivers as almost equal.

An outcome from our top drivers (Bottas, Hamilton, and Max) shows a clear advantage of Max and Hamilton over Bottas. Although, Max and Bottas have similar counts of podiums, it would appear from the lm model that max has the better of our reference driver Bottas.

#### No Podium Finish:

In terms of specificity, our Random Forest seemed to show the highest specificity and is used to explain the negative class (No Podium). A brief look at the Random Forest Model found the following variables to have high importance: grid, qualifying_dif, and driverRef. Running the model and finding the ROC curve found a threshold of 0.4. The model's overall accuracy was 84.2% and a specificity of 82.8%.

![Variable Importance Tree (Podium)](Figures/Forest_Pod_Imp_Tree.jpg){width="4in"}

The agreement across both models is that the car performance has a large effect on the winning a podium, whereas the Random Forest model lends a larger importance to grid than compared to the logistic model. When it comes to driver rankings, we are also seeing consistency for Verstappen having a higher influence than Hamilton. The lack of influence from LeClerc is interesting as well seeing that LeClerc scored 5th most podiums compared to the rest of our field.

### Running in the Mid-Field (Spots 1-6)

We used ROC curves on default settings to find an overview comparison of each model and their optimal threshold values for spots (1-6). (See Appendix for additional ROC curves)

# CONCLUSION TO PURPOSE 1

# PURPOSE 2 ANALYSIS (Type below this line and I will type above it.

To analyze the variable importance and coefficients found within Teams, which have very similar cars, and for Individuals. In other words... what factors have a higher importance for each team/individual? Is this a positive or negative correlation?

## Method

For each team/individual a random forest model will be used to assess Variable Importance. Secondly, a Logistic Regression model will be used to analyze coefficients. Teams were chosen so that the greatest number of data points were available where both team members remained the same. Individuals were chosen so that the greatest number of data points were available in which the team remained the same. The specific classification group (Win-Loss / Podium - Not / Top 6 - Not) that will be chosen for each team/individual will be based upon the highest Specificity & Sensitivity. We will not be analyzing one team against another, or one individual against another. Instead we will be focusing on the classification that provides the best approach to understanding that specific team/individual in question. For instance... Perez and Stroll do not finish in 1st enough times for the Win-Loss approach to be appropriate. On the other hand, Bottas & Hamilton rarely find themselves outside of the top 3.
